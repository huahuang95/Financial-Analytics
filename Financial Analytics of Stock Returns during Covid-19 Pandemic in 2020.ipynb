The correlation between `Quick Ratio` and `Cash/CL` is the highest among the X variables. Both of them use `Current Liabilities` as denominator, since liquid assets in `Quick Ratio` includes cash on hand or assets other than cash that can be quickly converted into cash, the high correlation makes sense.\n","3. The correlation between `Long-term Debt/TA` and `Cash/Interest Expense` have the highest negative correlation. We may infer that the firms with lower long-term debt have more cash to cover\n","immediate interest expenses. \n","4. Compared to `RetLate2020`, the correlations between each of market ratios and `RetEarly2020` are stronger. Since the ratios are derived from 2019, the connection might be stronger when it compares to the data closer to 2019, which is `RetEarly2020` in this case.\n","5. The correaltions between market ratios and `RetEarly2020` and `RetLate2020` are generally negative, which indicates that they’re negatively correlated.

industries, the telecommunication services sector (`ggroup_5010`) has the highest return rate in 2020, indicating the magnitude telecommunication sector impacted by the pandemic is the least. However, the negative change of return suggests the telecommunication services sector faced a loss in early 2020. We can infer that during the pandemic, people still rely on communication and require telecommunication services.\n","- Compared to the other industries, the energy sector (`ggroup_1010`) has the lowest returns in 2020. During the pandemic, people were confined to their homes and restricted to travel, resulting in a declined oil demand and a decrease in returns, which made the energy sector the sector impacted by the pandemic the worst.\n","\n","**RetLate2020**\n","- For late 2020, the consumer discretionary sector (`ggroup_2510`) has the highest return compared to the other industries. The pandemic caused a consumption shock due to the lockdown and forced shutdown across several industries. However, during recovering from the pandemic in 2020, people may have been accumulating more savings while forced to cut back on spending from lockdowns and travel restrictions. Thus, in late 2020, the consumer discretionary sector may have the highest bounce in return.\n","- In contrast, the utilities sector (`ggroup_5510`) has the lowest return growth among all the industries. If we compare to early 2020, the magnitude utilities industry affected by the pandemic was less than the other industries. We may infer that the pandemic comparatively less affected the sector. After the COVID-19 virus has been controlled, the extent it recovered from the pandemic would also be less than the other sectors. On the other hand, the utilities were affected by the stopped commercial activities and restrictions on public transport; power demand might take time to recover from the pandemic."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"GDQilylQDF1W"},"source":["#### ii.
